    <h2>From the Creator</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Amogh(its spelled A-mo-gh)!<br>
    <br>
    I am 13 yrs old and have been coding for almost 2 years now.<br>
    The webpage you are on is the first webpage I have ever made.<br>
    I had gotten inspired by other website creators like neal.fun to make this webpage.<br>
    It's on stats(staistics) of upto 196 countries!<br>
    It's still under construction though.(Could take quite a whileðŸ˜…)<br>
    But I have done a few things!<br>
    You can go and check them out by choosing the continent you want to see and then choose the country.<br>
    To go back to the main page, click the title of the webpage(Country Stats).<br>
    To my main website, search up thewebsitecode.github.io.<br>
    Stay tuned for more webpages!<br>
    Have a good day!</p>
